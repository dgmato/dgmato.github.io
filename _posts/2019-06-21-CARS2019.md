The CARS conference is a truly international and interdisciplinary conference bringing together radiologists, surgeons, computer scientists, engineers, physicists, and other researchers at a unique meeting, where together they contribute to, and in fact lead, the development of novel methodologies and applications in this fast-growing field of technology for health care. 

There I presented the work titled "Structured Light Scanning for Morphometric Analysis in Craniosynostosis Reconstruction Surgery".
