**Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery conference 2018** was held from June 20th to June 23th at the Hotel NH Collection Berlin Mitte in **Berlin, Germany**. The CARS congress is an annual event for a distinguished international community of scientists, engineers and physicians to present and discuss the key innovations that shape modern medicine on a worldwide basis.

Founded in 1983, CARS has played a leading role in medical and imaging informatics for more than 30 years by focusing on research and development on novel algorithms and systems and their applications in radiology and surgery. Its growth and impact is due to CARSâ€™s close collaboration with the IFCARS, ISCAS, CAR, CAD, CMI and IPCAI organizations.
