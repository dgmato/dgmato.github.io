---

**MICCAI 2020**, the *23nd International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention*, was held from October 4th to 8th, 2020 in **Lima, Peru**.

The annual MICCAI conference attracts world leading biomedical scientists, engineers, and clinicians from a wide range of disciplines associated with medical imaging and computer assisted intervention.

The conference series includes three days of oral presentations and poster sessions. MICCAI 2020 also includes workshops, tutorials, and challenges on the days preceding and succeeding the conference. These satellite events offer a comprehensive forum to further explore topics relevant to MICCAI.

I had an active role in the organization of the conference as **Social and Sport Events Officer** of the **MICCAI student board**. The MICCAI student board represents student interests within the **MICCAI society** since 2010. Our goals are to: (1) stimulate the involvement of students, (2) enhance networking in the community, (3) to advise the MICCAI board on matters of relevance for students.

During MICCAI 2020, we offered a great variety of events and activities for the community. These events were: the MICCAI educational challenge, academia & industry event, yoga classes, online games night, two webinars, and, finally, we provided videos and material to discover the history and traditions of Peru.

I had the opportunity to present my work titled **"Augmented Reality Visualization for Craniosynostosis Surgery"** at the Augmented Environments for Computer Assisted Interventions (AE-CAI), Computer Assisted and Robotic Endoscopy (CARE) and Context-Aware Operating Theaters (OR 2.0) workshop.
