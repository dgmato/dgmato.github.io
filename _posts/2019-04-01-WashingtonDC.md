From January to March 2019, I was working at the Sheikh Zayed Institute for Pediatric Surgical Innovation of Children's National Health System in Washington, DC, United States. 

There, I worked with Marius George Linguraru in automatic surgical planning for craniosynostosis reconstruction surgeries.
