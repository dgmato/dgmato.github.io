title: CARS 2020 - Munich (Germany)
---

From June 23rd to June 27th, I attended the Computer-Assisted Radiology and Surgery (CARS) 2020 conference held in Munich, Germany. 

The CARS conference is a truly international and interdisciplinary conference bringing together radiologists, surgeons, computer scientists, engineers, physicists, and other researchers at a unique meeting, where together they contribute to, and in fact lead, the development of novel methodologies and applications in this fast-growing field of technology for health care.

There I presented the work titled “Intraoperative Outcome Evaluation in Craniosynostosis Reconstruction Surgery using 3D Photography”.
