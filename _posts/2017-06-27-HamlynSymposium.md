title: Hamyln Symposium on Medical Robotics 2017
---

**10th Hamyln Symposium on Medical Robotics** was held from June 25th to 28th at the Royal Geographical Society in **London, United Kingdom**. The program included keynotes speeches from *Professor Dong-Soo Kwon* of the *Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)* in Korea; *Dr Catherine Mohr* from *Intuitive Surgical*; *Professor Joseph Sung* from the *Chinese University of Hong Kong* and *Professor Andrew Turberfield* from the *University of Oxford*.

I presented the work "3D Gaze Tracking based on Eye and Head Pose Tracking" [1], which covers the development and validation of a 3D gaze tracking system based on mobile eye tracking glasses and real-time tracking with an optical tracking system. I did this work during my time as a visiting research student at the Laboratory for Percutaneous Surgery at Queen's University in Kingston, ON, Canada.
