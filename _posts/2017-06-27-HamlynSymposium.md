I presented the work "3D Gaze Tracking based on Eye and Head Pose Tracking" [1], which covers the development and validation of a 3D gaze tracking system based on mobile eye tracking glasses and real-time tracking with an optical tracking system. I did this work during my time as a visiting research student at the Laboratory for Percutaneous Surgery at Queen's University in Kingston, ON, Canada.

I presented a poster and teaser. My poster was selected between the best 6 posters of the conference.
