# Hands-on Tutorial on Rapid Prototyping of Ultrasound-guided intervention Systems

On September 16th, I participated as instructor and organizer of the tutorial ["Hands-on Tutorial on Rapid Prototyping of Ultrasound-guided intervention Systems"](http://www.slicerigt.org/wp/miccai-2018-tutorial/). This tutorial was a satellite event of the 21st International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention held from September 16th to 20th, 2018 in Granada, Spain.

This tutorial was organized in collaboration with the Laboratory of Percutaneous Surgery (PerkLab) from Queen's University, Kingston, ON Canada.

The objective of the tutorial was to teach participants how to develop image-guided surgery applications using free open-source software, such as [3D Slicer](https://www.slicer.org/), [SlicerIGT](http://www.slicerigt.org/wp/), [OpenIGTLink](http://openigtlink.org/) and [PLUS Toolkit](https://plustoolkit.github.io/). During the first part of the tutorial a brain surgery navigation system to guide a brain tumor biopsy was developed and tested using an anthropomorphic phantom and a optical tracking system. During the second part of the tutorial, we explained how ultrasound imaging can be integrated into any image-guided surgery application and the different methodologies available for the calibration of the ultrasound system.
