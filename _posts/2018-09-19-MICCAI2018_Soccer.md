title: Soccer at MICCAI 2018
---

A soccer game was organized by the MICCAI student board on September 19th from 7pm to 10pm. Despite the rain of that afternoon, we were 25 players for the game. We had a great time playing soccer and we meet a lot of new people.

A picture of the group in front of the Granada FC Stadium (we did not played in that stadium though):


All this was possible thanks to the efforts of the MICCAI student board, which stimulates the involvement of students within the MICCAI community. Apart from the soccer game, other activities were organized: running, flamenco dancing lessons, city tour and guided hiking tour in Sierra Nevada.
